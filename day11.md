In today's section, I learned about Figma. From where I left, I continued to do the Figma. Arul helped to learn more about Figma. Today I learned to group how to make a group, making the group can make the container as one so that we can move easy whichever place we want in the frame. To swipe the image in frames 2,3 and 4 without moving other things present in that frame's we have to keep other text or images similar So that they will not move other than the image. And then I do a frame for sign in, for creating a new id, for creating the account using google e-mail ID. Then I created\ the first frame for the app, after creating all frame's I started and completed doing prototypes for all frames I have done today. And my mentor Joel corrected the mistakes in the article to improve my grammar, spelling, writing skill's mentor suggested me a website called Grammarly, which is more helpful for writing. The Figma design done by me is in the below link.

                In the afternoon section for the intern section, Koushik teaches us a non-technical topic. he teach us about the top mathematical logic, In that topic, we learned about Propositional logic, Propositional logic is noting but was the statements are neither true nor false, based on the propositional logic we have three propositional mainly conjunctions, disjunction, and negotiation. Negotiation means the statement is not true for example the house is red, but it is not in red. Conjunction means the two statements, which are neither true nor false. Disjunction means if any statements are wrong then the final disjunction is wrong. Then he teaches us about logical implication, logical implication means the statement one implied to other statements. Biconditional statement, the statement is true if and only if the other statement is true.this all I learned intoday section
