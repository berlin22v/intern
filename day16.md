By discussing this I was able to know the progress of the project going on. 
Then in the session of the internship class, Koushik teaches us about the algorithm. When we give the input to the computer, the input goes to the memory and its processes and gives the output. And he gave the team a task to solve in the class, to write an algorithm for the sum that the robot has to go to the library and get a non-fiction book, Read the name of the book, and put it back. We have done this task within the given time.
