##DAY 21 ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION
It's day 21 of the internship, I have done Figma, Learn about flutter, and learn about the Programming languages.
RESEARCH  
1. Figma
2. Flutter
3. Programming Language
UNDERSTAND IN TODAY'S SESSION
I do UI designs in Figma. Then, I started learning the Flutter in Dart language, the mobile UI has three different parts, are App bar, the Body, and the Bottom navbar. In the app bar, there are three parts Leading, Title, and Action; Body has column and row. The box is known as a container. The scaffold is a white screen.  The keyword is written in camelCase and the class name in capital letter. In flutter, everything is known as wedges. Classes should be in [ ] and List should be in ( ). To move the title in the center we have to use the comment ( centerTitle:true). To change the color ( backgroundColor:color.red ), this comment is used. The elevation is to show the shadow of the app bar. To change the text style ( style:TextStyle(fontStyle:FontStyle.IUtalic)), this comment is used. And I learn the difference between padding and margin. About this flutter was taught by my mentor Joel. And then in the internship class session of Koushik, I learned that English has a noun, verb, etc. Same as a programming language. It is just another language we have to look at it from that perspective.
So the thing is we have to understand its symbols, tokens, expressions, rules, etc to communicate with the computer.
As I said in English we have nouns etc same in a programming language but in a different word, they are "int, bool, the string" etc.
CONCLUSION
Today I learned about flutter and looking forward to learning more.
