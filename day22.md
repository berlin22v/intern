#SUMMARY
##DAY 22 ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION
It's day 22 of the internship, I have done Figma, Learn about flutter, and learn about the Programming languages.
RESEARCH  
1. Figma
2. Flutter
3. Programming Language
UNDERSTAND IN TODAY'S SESSION
I do UI designs in Figma,  And I completed the design for the users. I learn Flutter to do to circle in the container.
CONCLUSION
Today I learned about flutter and looking forward to learning more. And, Today at last in the evening We had an internship session, In this session, I learned things about the programming language of the computer. We have many programming languages like C, C++, JAVA, Python, Javascript, etc..,
 - How do we have symbols, tokens, expressions, the syntax for being the English language as English. something there is a token, symbols, expressions, for a computer programming language.
 - Symbols of the programming languages are UNICODE it has 144697 symbols and letters different from 159 scripts.
 - Tokens are Identifier(idn),Operators(op),Puncutators(p),Numerical Literals(nl),String literals(sl) etc..,
 - Expressions are a combination of tokens. these tokens are separated by spaces.
 - keywords - async,const,await,continue,cat etc..,
 - Then we learned about Datatypes. Datatypes give information about the type of data. there are a variety of datatypes namely primitive and composite data types some of the examples of data types are:
 ex:1.String,numbers(or)int,float,double,boolean etc..,these are primitive data types.
   2.Arrays,objects,functions are composite datatype.
  ** Array:
   -Basically, the array is the storage or collection of data stored in a single variable. Syntax of the array is.
   1. Array starts and ends with square brackets [],
   2. Inside the brackets are elements of the array.
   3. Each Element of the array is separated by commas(,).
   4.Sentence terminator (or) Punctuator is semicolon(;).
  ex:Arrar1 = [0,1,2,3];
 ** Object: 
   - In object used to store the key value of elements. we have two things one is key and value. Syntax pf object is.
    1. Object start and end with curly braces {}.
    2. Formation of the object is by key and value.
    3. Key and value are separated by (:).
    4. Each Key and value end with(,).
    5. Keys need to be unique.
    6.Key can be string,Variable.
   ex: {
      a : "hi",
      b : "hello",
     }
  ** Function;
    - Function are basically Variables.Syntax of function.
    1. Function should start with Function name().
    2.block of the function is start and end with {}.
    3 In Function body or block has literals,operators and sentence terminator,
    4.Finally call back the function name by Function name(); then only the function will run and execute the result.
   ex: 
     add() 
       {
       2+3;
       } 
      add();
These are topics I learned in the session taken by the Koushik
Conclusion
Learned about the Flutter, And the programming languages and looking forward to learning more.
