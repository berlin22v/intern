#SUMMARY
##DAY 23 ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION
It's day 23 of the internship, I have done Figma and learned about Programming languages.
RESEARCH  
1. Figma
2. Programming Language
UNDERSTAND IN TODAY'S SESSION
I do UI designs in Figma,  And I completed the design and I clarified doubts for tomorrow's presentation, With the help of my mentor Joel. Programming languages, Basically language is nothing but to communicate something with someone to understand. Programming language is the same but the communication between Users and computer software. There are many programming languages which we used namely c, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Kotlin, Bitstring, etc...Data Types, A data type defines the type of value an object can have and what operations can be performed on it. A datatype should be declared first before being used. Different Programming languages support different data types. For Example,
  1. C supports char, int, float, long, etc..,
  2. Python supports String, List, Tuple, etc..,
  - In a broad sense, these are three types of datatypes:
   1. Fundamental data types
   2. Derived data types
   3. User-defined data types
 * Fundamental data types, These are the predefined data types that are used by the programmer directly to store only one value as per requirement.i.e integer type,character type,or floating type.
 * Derived data types, These data types are derived using built-in data types which are designed by the programmer to store multiple values of the same type as per their requirement.example-Array,pointer,function,list etc..,
* User-defined data types, these data types are derived using built-in datatypes which are wrapped into a single data type to store multiple values of either the same type or different type or both as per the requirement. Example, Class, Structure, etc.,
 * Data types supported by C++, char, unsigned char, signed char, int, unsigned int, signed int, short int, unsigned short int, signed short int, long int, signed long int, unsigned long int, float, double, long double.
 * Data supported by Java byte,char,short,int,long,float,double,boolean
Conclusion
Learned about the programming languages and did my UI design for doing my presentation. Looking forward to learning more.
