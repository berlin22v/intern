#SUMMARY
##DAY 24 ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION
It's day 24 of the internship, I have done Figma, Flutter, and learned about Compiler.
RESEARCH  
1. Figma
2. Flutter
3. Compiler
UNDERSTAND IN TODAY'S SESSION
I do UI designs in Figma,  And I completed the design. Then I continue to learn Flutter, In Flutter I learn about child, Main axis alignment which is used to move left for the row and top for a column, cross-axis alignment which is used to move right for the row and bottom for column and I lean to add an image for the internet by using the network image and know what is assart image. It was taught by my mentor Joel.
Then in the internship class Koushik teach us about the Compiler, A Compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer processor uses, For any language, It has been some set of principles or constraints to translate it into a required language which are,
   1. Lexical Analysis 
   2. Syntactical Analysis
   3. Semantical Analysis
   4. Code generation
  * Lexical Analysis, Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler also known as a scanner. It converts the High-level input program into a sequence of Tokens. The output is a sequence of tokens that are sent to the parser for syntax analysis.
  * Synaptic analysis, is the next phase of the compiler, In which the given input is checked for the confirmation of rules and structure of the formal grammar. whether an input is in the correct syntax of the programming language.
 * Semantical Analysis, It is used to check the input is incorrect meaning, These are the main phases which compiler does after this analysis computer send input to the code generator, This code generator converts the input into a machine language (i.e) 0 and 1, by using a compiler, it compiles the machine language into a required user language. these are the working process of the compiler.
#Conclusion
Learned about the compiler, did my UI design for doing my presentation and learned something in Flutter. Looking forward to learning more.
