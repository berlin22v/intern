##DAY25 ARTICLE
INTRODUCTION
It's day 25 of the internship, and we had a whole day session. 
RESEARCH  
1. Loop
2. Dart
3. Class
UNDERSTAND IN TODAY'S SESSION
The day starts with the session, Today we have a whole day session. In the morning Koushik taught about the for loop before that he gave a small recall with the last day session and he taught about how to use it in the dart pad. For loop, When using a for loop, we typically use a counter that will either increment or decrement until a condition is met. Once the condition is met, the loop will stop. Using this for loop, he gave some problems and I found the answer using for loop. Then he teach DART, It is nothing but a programming language designed for mobile applications. This dart is used in the flutter framework. Then I learned how to use the dartpad and how to run the code and execute the result. I tried one for loop problem and obtained the solution using dartpad. these are the things I learned from the dart pad. Then in the afternoon session, He taught about class, instance, constructor to us.CLASS, Basically classes are templates for creating objects. They encapsulate data to work on the data.Class are a "special functions",and it is similar to functions. It also has two components as the function has namely, Class expressions and class declarations. Constructor, constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. Then I learned about the execution stack and tried some problems based on the flow and execution stack. for example, in the problem, we have a certain condition and how we can solve using it easily by using execution stack. this was taught to us.
   - then he taught about variables in javascript like var, let, and also he gave some overview about scope. Then at finally, I learned about UI. UI is User Interface, which is a rectangle container or division that segregates by color, shape, position, content, etc.., Usually the UI interface or interaction between the user and system with the color, content, position.
Conclusion
Learned about the loop, Dart, Class, and UI designs. And we were separated as a team and given the project. The project team members of mine are Vijay Priya, Tazeen, Pandian, and David. And the product given to us is Note taking app, App should be able to log in anywhere, on any device, Should be able to add; delete, Use google firebase for the database and store the notes, And share the notes with others.
