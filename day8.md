##SUMMARY
      In today section,i learnd about how the apps work,the app is a type of software that allows us to perform specific task,the common term for an 
application is app.the application that are used in desktop or laptop,computer are called desktop application,the application used in mobile is know 
as mobile apps.Apps are a piece of saftware that can be downloaded on your computer,mobile or table.By using this app we can performe task easly,we 
can detb notification in the app.we can us that app faster,but update required for new versions.It consume more battery.There are three types of 
mobile app they are native app,web app and hybrid app.native app is for the specific operations,this native app is faster,have more more battery 
power,more stable;web app are use in the browsers,we no need to download it ,the web app is entirely depends on the browser,they need intrnet to work.Hybrid app is the combination of the web and native app,they have a home screen app icon.But they are really web app with a native app sell.And the 
andriod app are diffrent from the ios app main diffrents between two programming languages are ios app development with swift requires writing less
code,the ios apps are faster than andriod app,android apps are built mainly with java and kathlin,ios app built with swift .But now flutter is used to
built app for both,with the help of flutter we can create one app for both android and ios app.The tools used for ios are mac computer running in 
latest version of Xcode and Xcode is a graphicaly interface you'll use to write ios app.The best tool that are needed for building android apps are
 andriod studio,androis virtual device,eclipse,fabic,flow up,etc..After the flutter arrives we no need seprate tools to make app for both ios and 
android app.some of the apps done by the flutter are gpay,google adds,BMW,dream11,Tencent,Alibaba,Toyota,Wrapping up,Nubank,etc..And also i learned 
about Operating System (OS),it is a software programme required to manage and operate a computing device. this topic were given by my mentor Joel i
