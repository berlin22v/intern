#SUMMARY
##DAY_12 ARTICLE

INTRODUCTION
               It was the 12th day of the internship, and I was able to continue designing and clarifying more doubt. I can able to research more today and learn more. 
RESEARCH
    #What is API and how does API work.
    #About the bus root and time
    #About the google map and there features
UNDERSTAND IN TODAY'S SESSION
                In today's session, I learned about API. Applin Programming Interface is known as API. It is software that allows two applications to talk to each other. For example, if we open Facebook, API talks to the Facebook app and tell it to open the Facebook data of us that it holds. Then, I start researching public buses. By researching, I was able to know more about the app that I am working on. And I go through the apps like Google Maps and Aanavandi app, that apps are very used to find my uniqueness in my app. 
                 In the intern class session, Koushik gave us the assignment to do. And then he taught about "IDEAL TEAM PLAYERS" the book written by Patrick Lencioni, In this book, he told that to be the ideal team player, A person should have three qualities. The three qualities are Humble, Hungry, and Smart. He also mentions that to be the ideal team player, the person should good equal in all three qualities. If the person is only good at Humble and not at Hungry and smart then the person is Pawns, If the person is only good at Hungry and not at Humble and smart then the person is Bull-dozers; they are otherwise known as team distraction, If the person is only good at Smart and not at Hungry and Humble then the person is Charmen; they have no personal growth but they have a good relationship with another person. If the person is good at both Humble and Hungry but not Smart then the person is an Accidental mess maker, If the person is good at both Humble and Smart but not Hungry then the person is lovable slacks; they stay long in company, If the person is good at both Smart and Hungry but not Humble then the person is skillful politicians; they are major distractions and don't care about anyone. So the person should have three qualities to be the ideal team player.
